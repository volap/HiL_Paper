	The developed experimental platform has since been used to conduct field tests and successfully performed in an A-double combination consisting of two 40t-semi-trailers towed by a tractor. The two axles of the experimental platform functioned as a dolly steering the first two axles of the second semi-trailer. Results are promising and now need to be researched further to have a fine-tuned setup that correlates simulation, \gls{HIL}-environment and the vehicle in the field sufficiently well to also allow for safe tests at higher speeds. A variety of different steering algorithms can then be evaluated.
	
	%The experimental platform can be taken further by adding wheel-individual propulsion or braking to expand the possibilities of intervention for the tested algorithms. A possibility to have faster response-times by further reducing the delays outlined in section \ref{chap:Delays} is to directly control the hydraulic steering system, completely circumventing the legacy \gls{ECU}s.
