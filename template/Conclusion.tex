\label{chap:Conclusion}


A platform which provides steering of two axles in a truck-combination was developed. Both axles can be steered independently.

A compact software interface for the algorithm development process was created, enabling access to the platform's hardware in the native Simulink environment. This interface already includes first safety functions to limit undesired inputs. Based on experience from simulations, further rules can be conveniently implemented. This enables the development of steering algorithms and functions on an abstract level without the need to consider lower level hardware issues. 

The experimental platform was linked with a vehicle dynamics framework to form a \gls{HIL}-system, which enables safe evaluation of a whole combination on vehicle level with two axles as hardware in the lab. The correlation between the simulation results and the \gls{HIL}-tests was achieved accurately enough to continue with track testing.
