\section{Conclusion}
\label{chap:Conclusion}


A platform which allows the independent steering of two axles in a truck-combination was developed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A fairly compact software interface for the algorithm development process was developed, enabling access to the platform's hardware in the native Simulink environment. 
	\item This interface already includes first safety functions to limit undesired inputs. Based on experience from simulations, further rules can be conveniently implemented
	developed
	\item The experimental platform was linked with a vehicle dynamics framework to form a \gls{HIL}-system, which enables safe evaluation of a whole combination with two axles as hardware in the lab.
	\item The correlation between the simulation results and the \gls{HIL}-tests was achieved accurately enough to continue with field tests. 
	\item A system for plotting and logging the relevant data was developed
\end{itemize}
