\begin{abstract}

\gls{HCT}-vehicles require different strategies in controlling lateral dynamics of the combinations to ensure optimal paths taken by the trailers. These steering algorithms have been developed in previous works and now need to be verified on the track. This work thus implemented a dolly experimentation platform incorporating a rapid-prototyping system to provide the possibility of evaluating these algorithms. The solution is detailed as a \gls{HIL}-test linked with a vehicle dynamics frame-work in this publication. Results for this setups utilizing the aforementioned algorithms are presented and discussed. Nevertheless it is possible to run the outlined solution on-track, for which some suggestions are given at the end of this work.

\section{Introduction}



\begin{itemize}
\item HCT gut fuer umwelt
\item Economy
\item Off-tracking reduction

\end{itemize}
 
The following points will be covered in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item hardware and software utilized to achieve \gls{HIL} verification for an active converter dolly
\item evaluation of existing delays in the implementation and their consequences
\item discussion of three standard maneuvers for \gls{HCT}-combinations executed on the  developed \gls{HIL}-system and their comparison with simulation results
\item propose necessary changes to the set-up for taking the developed solution to the test-track in the future
\end{itemize}


\section{Hardware-setup}



\subsection{dolly}

The hardware base is a dolly manufactured by Parator Industries. The steering system is based around the \gls{ETS} developed and built by \gls{VSE} with two hydraulically steerable axles. It was originally meant to be used in trailer steering and as an after-market system does not tie in with any of the truck's communication networks or sensor data. This makes it OEM-independent and very robust. The \gls{ETS} solely relies on the articulation angle between the leading and following unit on which the system is mounted and the speed of the combination. The articulation angle is gathered via a dedicated sensor mounted on the king-pin, the speed-signal is gathered from the ISO-11992 \gls{CAN}.

\subsection{MABII}

To execute the readily developed algorithms\cite{c27}, that govern the steering of the \gls{HCT}-combination needed to be ported to a platform, capable of interacting with the dolly and the tractor, while ensuring robust behavior during run-time. It was decided to incorporate the \gls{MABII} by dSpace, a real-time platform for its advantages in automotive environments with a vast selection of in- and outputs for interfacing with vehicular communications systems (\gls{CAN}, ethernet, FlexLink). It conveniently ties in with Simulink, which was used for algorithm development, for code-generation. Furthermore it physically is very robust and has good logging possibilities.

\section{CONCLUSIONS}



\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
