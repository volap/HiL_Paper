%A robustness analysis with respect to the actuator model variation and its effect on the overall performance is performed.
%The advanced controller is designed using a nonlinear inversion of plant with actuator dynamics in it.
%New technique: nonlinear inverse model based control strategy using Modelica standard to design the active safety systems of high capacity transport vehicles for stability improvement at high speeds.

\section{Introduction}



\begin{itemize}
\item HCT gut fuer umwelt
\item Economy
\item Off-tracking reduction

\end{itemize}
 
Our conclusion is simple: the application of a Modelica language based simulation tool, such as Dymola, is very attractive to design the nonlinear inverse model controller for active dolly steering systems of HCT vehicles.

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}

%The preferred spelling of the word ÒacknowledgmentÓ in America is without an ÒeÓ after the ÒgÓ. Avoid the stilted expression, ÒOne of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . .Ó  Instead, try ÒR. B. G. thanksÓ. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
