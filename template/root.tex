\begin{abstract}

\gls{HCT}-vehicles require different strategies in controlling lateral dynamics of the combinations to ensure optimal paths taken by the trailers. Promising steering algorithms actuating more then one axles of the combination have been developed in previous works \cite{islam2015improve},\cite{islam2015inverse} and now need to be verified in the field. This work thus developed an experimentation platform incorporating a rapid-prototyping system to provide the possibility of evaluating these algorithms. In this publication the solution is detailed as a \gls{HIL}-platform linking a vehicle dynamics frame-work with two steered axles. In accordance with the automotive development process after the V-model\cite{automotive_software_engineering}, this allows to safely verify the functioning of both software and hardware before performing track-tests of the fully integrated system. This paper outlines the development and capabilities of the resulting experimental platform and gives a short example of its performance in a standard-maneuver, which is also used to proof the validity between simulation and \gls{HIL}-environment enabling full system testing.
