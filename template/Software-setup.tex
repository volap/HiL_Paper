%In this section a short overview of the utilized software and its interdependencies shall be given. 
%
%\subsection{\gls{VTM}}
%
%To evaluate the dynamic performance of the \gls{HCT}-combination Volvo Group Truck Technolgy's\cite{volvogtt} \gls{VTM} library came to use. It is a library developed in and for Simulink environment and permits the simulation of truck dynamics based on a multi-body model for the kinematic relation and a parametrized tire model using the magic formula. %Many different \gls{LCV} configurations, road-situations and maneuver definitions come pre-defined with the tool-kit enabling a fairly quick implementation of full vehicle simulations. 
%
%\subsection{RTI blockset}
%
%dSPACE's rapid-prototyping platform's connection with Simulink is centered around a library which provides access to all physical communication ports on the \gls{MABII}, real-time execution on the target hardware and straight forward code-generation and -download. It was used to implement the \gls{CAN} communication with the \gls{ETS}, the \gls{EBS} and will be used to incorporate more signals from the truck's chassis \gls{CAN} in the future. Another use of the block-set was to ensure \gls{UDP} communication within the \gls{HIL} testing, as the Ethernet-port on the \gls{MABII} was used to supply data from the hardware system to the simulated sub-systems.
%
%\subsection{ControlDesk}
%
%As the simulation is executed on the \gls{MABII} it is possible to access representations of all blocks and their values and properties that are part of the abstract Simulink model which was generated to the \gls{MABII}. It is thus possible to have a user-friendly system-state monitor. A number of \gls{GUI} creation tools permit fast development. During the execution, ControlDesk runs on a standard PC, which accesses the \gls{MABII}'s RAM via ethernet connection.
